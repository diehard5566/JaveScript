// You have cultivated a plant, and after three long months, the time has come to reap the fruits (or the flowers, in this case) of your hard work.
// During the growth phase, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time to check how much the plant has grown!

// A plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:

// ---@---@---@
// The stem is made of hyphens, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.

// The four given parameters are:

// seed (string) determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
// water (integer) each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers,
// and gives the total number of segments (stem + flowers) of the plant.
// fert (integer) each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters.
// temp (integer) if the temperature recorded is between 20°C and 30°C (bounds included) the plant grows normally,
//  otherwise all the flowers die, except for a single survivor at the end of the stem.
// Given the above parameters, implement a function that returns a string representing the plant (see the examples below for a better visualization).

const plant = (seed, water, fert, temp) => {
    console.log(('-'.repeat(water) + seed.repeat(fert)).repeat(water))

            result += '-'.repeat(water)
            for (let j = 0; j < fert; j++) {
                result += seed
            }
        }
        return result

plant('@', 3, 3, 25) // "---@@@---@@@---@@@"
// Water gives the length of the stem portions between flowers.
// Water gives the total number of segments.
// Fertilizer gives the length of flowers clusters.
// In this case the temperature is in the acceptable range 20°C | 30°C

// The temperature out of range make all flowers die, except the last one.
// The stem is not affected by temperature.
