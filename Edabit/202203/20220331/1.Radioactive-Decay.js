// A half life is the amount of time for half of a radioactive substance to decay.

// After 1 half life, 50% of a substance will be left.
// After 2 half lives, 25% of a substance will be left.
// After 3 half lives, 12.5% of a substance will be left, etc...
// Create a function which calculates the remaining mass and the number of years that it took for the substance to decay.
//  You will be given:

// The mass of the substance.
// The time in years for a halflife to elapse.
// The number of half lives.
